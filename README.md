# Budge - an arcade/puzzle game

This is an HTML/Javascript port of the original [Budge by Nat
Pryce](https://github.com/npryce/budge). Play at
https://emosenkis.github.io/budge/budge.html.

It can be thought of as a cross between Sokoban, Pac-Man and Blind Date (the
TV show).

The object of the game is complete every level by getting the two monsters on
each level to bump into each other. One of the monsters wanders about 
aimlessly, turning every time it bumps into anything. The other chases you 
mercilessly, but stupidly. To help manoever the monsters together the levels 
contain walls, gates, pushable discs and freeze-pills. However, certain objects
kill the player and some walls are invisible. Colliding with a monster is fatal
too.
